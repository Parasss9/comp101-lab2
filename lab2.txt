When Bob clicks the GitHub link, his device acts as a client and so do GitHub computers as servers. The browser takes the URL, asks the DNS system to translate github.com into an IP address, and then connects securely to that server. Bobâ€™s browser sends the HTTP GET request asking for the repository page. The server processes the request, finds the repository data, and returns it with an HTTP response with a web page. Finally, the browser receives and renders the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and shows the repository page on-screen for Bob.
